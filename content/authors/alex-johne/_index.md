Originally from Munich, Germany, Alex moved to Hobart about 3 years ago to study Marine Biology at IMAS. Since graduating in December she has been working as a research assistant for the lab group and was one of the main contributors to the website. She will be starting her Honours project in July which will focus on applying a simple size spectrum model to a recirculation aquaculture system (RAS).
