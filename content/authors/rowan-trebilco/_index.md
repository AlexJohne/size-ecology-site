Rowan is currently a Research Fellow with Antarctic Climate & Ecosystem Cooperative Research Centre ([ACE CRC](http://acecrc.org.au)), but will be moving into a Research Scientist position with the Commonwealth Scientitic and Industrial Research Organisation, CSIRO, as of July.

In the CRC, Dr Trebilcoâ€™s focus has been on engaging with national and international collaborators to develop models, methods and analyses to facilitate assessment of Southern Ocean ecosystem status and trends, and to advance fundamental understanding of ecosystem structure and function.
