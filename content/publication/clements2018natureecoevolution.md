abstract = "To the Editor - In our original publication we analysed changes in the 95th percentile body size caught whales as this has been shown to provide robust indicatiions of changes in the body size distribution of harvested individuals. However, Clapham and Ivashchenko raise the legitimate concern that if a large proportion of the data were falsified then even this relatively robust measure might show erroneous trends. The data we accessed from the International Whaling Commission (IWC) included reports from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) fleet for body size data, as we were unaware of the potentially large-scale falsification of body size lengths. However, we are able to show that even when all records from Ussr and Japanese fleets are removed from the dataset, the declining trend in the size of harvested whales remains present. ... "
