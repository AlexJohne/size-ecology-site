abstract = "Climate change is accelerating and is already affecting the marine environment. Estimating the effects of climate change on the production of fish resources, and their dependent soci-eties, is complex because of: 1.  difficulties  of  downscaling  Global  Climate  Models  (GCM)  to  scales  of  biological  relevance; 2.  uncertainties  over  future  net  primary  production  and  its  transfer  through  the  food  chain; 3.  difficulties in separating the multiple stressors affecting fish production; and 4.  inadequate methodology to estimate human vulnerabilities to these changes.QUEST_Fish, a research project led from the UK, is addressing some of these challenges through an innovative, multi-disciplinary approach focused on estimating the added impacts that climate change is likely to cause, and the subsequent additional risks and vulnerabili-ties of these effects for human societies. The project uses coupled shelf seas biophysical ecosystem  models  forced  by  GCM  forecasts  to  predict  ecosystem  functioning  in  past, present,  and  future  time-slices.  For  each  slice,  and  for  20  Large  Marine  Ecosystems,  we  estimate plankton production and use this to estimate size-based fish production through models based on macro-ecological theory. Ways of assessing vulnerability of fisheries to future  climate  change  are  developed,  including  the  market  consequences  for  fish-based  global commodities. The results provide a new framework and new insights into the complex interactions between humans and nature."
