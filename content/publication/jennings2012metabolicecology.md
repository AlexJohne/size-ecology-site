abstract = "1. Variations in metabolic rate with body size and temperature drive patterns of energy acquisition and use. These have consequences for the life histories of marine plants and animals and the structure and function of populations, communities, and ecosystems. 2. Small primary producers and size-based predation characterize marine ecosystems. Since the transfer of energy to predators at each step in the food chain is inefficient, less energy is available for larger individuals at higher trophic levels. 3. Changes in energy supply and demand with size account for observed trends in abundance with size. These are often described with 'size spectra', log-log relationships between total abundance of individuals and their body size. Slopes of size spectra are remarkably consistent among ecosystems that differ in productivity and temperature. 4. Models of the processes structuring size spectra rely on the principles of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). Species identities are often ignored in these models, because many of the key processes depend mire on body size than on taxonomic identity. 5. Limited parameter demands of size-based models simplify application to diverse systems at many scales. Size-based models have been used to investigate the effects of food chain coupling and the role of prey size selection, as well as to predict fish production, community size composition, and fishing impacts. 6. Accounting for species identity in a size-based framework provides additional insight into life-history trade-offs and food web structure. The approach also supports analysus and advice on management issues that are species focused. 7. Applications of size- and species-based models include the analysis and prediction of life histories in a community context and the assessment of trade-offs between fishing and conservation. 8. Metabolic ecology underpins the assessment and management of fishing impacts on populations, communities, and ecosystems. The drivers for developing these methods remain strong because they are providing new insights into marine ecology and because fishery managers increasingly demand advice that places fishery management in a community and ecosystem context."
