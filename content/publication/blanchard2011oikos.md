abstract = "The study of processes that drive ecosystem structure and resilience to natural and human‐mediated change is central to ecology. This is especially important in light of our current need to understand the implications of global biodiversity loss and climate change. It has long been acknowledged that body size influences many processes: ranging from individual biological rates up to the structure of food webs and the provision of human ecosystem services such as food. Going back to the work of Elton (1927), when the field of ecology was in its infancy, we are reminded of the complexities of ecological communities and the important role of humans within these. Elton described how complex communities could be better understood by considering four general principles: (1) food‐chains and the food‐cycle; (2) size of food; (3) niches and (4) the pyramid of numbers. The fourth seemed a pretty obvious pattern to Elton although he did not have a sophisticated dataset on hand to analyse it."
