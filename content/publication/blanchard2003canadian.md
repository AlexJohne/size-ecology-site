abstract = "A fecundity study of the eastern Scotian Shelf haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) stock during the 1997-1999 spawning season is reported. We developed a model that accounted for fecundity changes at the individual level and that could be used to estimate population egg production beyond the study period. Incorporating condition factors into the model (relative condition factor (Kn) and hepatosomatic index) accounted for a significant proportion of the residual variation. The model predicted that a change in Kn from 0.8 to 1.0 resulted in a twofold increase in fecundity at length. This variability was as great as that observed for fecundity-length relationships among stocks. Three time series (1979-2001) of total egg production (TEP) were constructed using different fecundity relationships: one with a condition effect, on based on length only, and one based on weight only. The magnitude of change in TEP resulting from the condition effect ranged from +30 to -20%. Condition effects during the first half of the time series resulted in an enhancement of TEP, whereas in the latter half, condition effects depressed TEP. This evaluation of TEP generated new insights into haddock stock dynamics but did not result in a dramatic improvement of the relationship between recruitment and stock reproductive potential. "
